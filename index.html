It’s not just reading books, it’s about exploring different cultures, histories, and emotions through the eyes of people who live totally different lives. I feel like every story, whether it’s a novel, a poem, or a play, shows me something new or makes me think differently. It’s also really cool how you start to see how humans, no matter where they're from or what time period they’re in, go through similar feelings, love, fear, anger, hope.<br><br> And honestly, World Lit isn’t just about the past; it’s about seeing how these stories still matter now. They remind me that my view of the world is small, but reading them helps me see things a little bigger.</p>
